      <i>About たまご ｃｏｏｋ (tamago cook)</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b><i>たまご ｃｏｏｋ</i></b>, is a website portfolio that i made during the December 2022. 2022 is the year that I got interested in coding, especially in web development. I've been doing a lot of mini-projects when i did learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Creating the <b><i>たまご ｃｏｏｋ</i></b> website is a challenge to myself to apply all the things that I have learned so far about web development. I am also a Hospitality Management student now in my college, and making a recipe website is one of the things that I wanted to do, plus, I like the egg recipes :)
